* Windows Terminal Settings
Settings for [[https://github.com/microsoft/terminal][Windows Terminal]].

These are located in ~"$env:USERPROfile/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows Terminal"~ for the preview version (*1.1.1671.0*)and in ~"$env:USERPROFILE/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState"~ for the main release (*1.0.1401.0*). Which is a bit annoying.

There are now updated manuals at [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/][Microsoft Docs]] regarding settings and options.

I'm using *Delugia Nerd Font* since the suggested font, *Cascadia Code*, didn't have Powerline fonts at the time. But there is a new version that includes this, *Cascadia-PL*.
